# Touch Marker

A nice looking touch-marker that fades in and out on touchstart/touchmove/touchend document events. Perfect for showing 
touches on a tabletop device, iPad, TUIO project, etc.

Animation based off one of the "subtle click feedback effects" in [this codrops article](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/02/11/subtle-click-feedback-effects/).
